## Overview

In the retro Japanese shooting game Space Invaders, the player is tasked with shooting aliens that slowly approach from space.
For our Computational Thinking for Design project, we have recreated the foundational mechanics of this game but translated the aliens and the player's objective to that of solving maths equations.
The aliens have been replaced by a set of integers that represent answers to a set of equations that appear on the screen, and only by clearing all equations can the player win the game.

## Motivation and Target Users

We hope that this alteration of the game's core mechanics will serve as an educational opportunity for young children in the early stages of school.
This includes students in primary school but can also include any other persons wishing to improve upon their mental calculation skills.
By providing an engaging medium in which to practice these skills, students can better motivate themselves to train and practice on these fundamental mathematical concepts.

## Playing the Game

The game is started by selecting a difficulty on the main menu.
Player input in the game is controlled by the left and right arrow keys, and bullets are spawned with the spacebar.
The objective is to shoot the number that corresponds with the answer for the equation displayed on the top right.
All questions must be answered before the numbers can touch the player sprite.

## Features

The game generates random math equations that are displayed at the top of the game based on the chosen difficulty level.
The numbers that replicate the 'alien invaders' from the original game have identical movement patterns to simulate a sense of urgency.
There is a score leader board that showcases the top 5 scores for each difficulty from other players to promote competitiveness.
The game also features sound effects and background music to boost engagement.

## To run:

install public-pixel-font

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Documentation

### Libraries

```python
import turtle
import math
import random
import time
import json
from itertools import cycle
import sys
import subprocess
from threading import Thread
```

### Directory Structure

```bash
├── data.json
├── digits
├── functions
│   ├── equations.py
│   ├── game_bg.py
│   ├── game_icons.py
│   ├── jsonfunc.py
│   └── start_page.py
├── game_gifs
├── game_music
├── main.py
└── public-pixel-font
```

- data.json contains the respective user name and their scores
- digits contains the images 0-99 which will be used as 'enemies' in the game
- functions is a folder containing the following python files with the various functions that will be called in main.py
  ```python
  #imports function used to send and get data from json file
  from functions import jsonfunc.py
  #imports function to setup startpage
  from functions import start_page.py
  #function to create equations for beginner/advanced mode
  from functions import equations.py
  #imports functions related to background of game
  from functions import game_bg.py
  #imports functions related to icons used in game eg. player
  from functions import game_icons.py
  ```

## Game Music

All background music in this code is played using thread and subprocess with the following syntax

```python
if sys.platform == 'linux2':
        bgmusic = subprocess.Popen(["afplay","<soundfile>"])
    elif sys.platform == 'darwin':
        bgmusic = subprocess.Popen(["afplay","<soundfile>"])
```

The above code is then attached to a thread using a function to allow for it to be run concurrently with the game.

## Functions

<br/>

### jsonfunc.py

```python
#returns sorted scores for advanced and beginner mode to display on startpage
startpagescrs()
#takes in player name and score and stores it in data.json
endpagescr(nameInput,game_mode,score)
```

### start_page.py

```python
#Takes in sorted scores and displays top 5 for each mode on the start screen of game followed by respective icons. together with start page background and icons as turtle objects. Background music for start screen is played here
start_page(beginnerScores,advScores)
```

### equations.py

```python
#generates beginner level questions eg. a + 9 = 13
generate_qn_beginner()
#generates advanced level questions eg. a x 93 = 4836
generate_qn_advanced()
```

### game_bg.py

```python
#sets up all game icons and 'enemies'(digits)
bg_setup()
#clears/hides background icons
bg_end()
#closes turtle window
quit_game()
#takes in qn num and eqns dictionary andwrites qn onto turtle screen
write_qn(qn_num,eqns)
```

### game_icons.py

```python
#setup player,bullet,tick,cross,reset,quit icons
icons_setup()
#hiding icons when game is over
icons_end()
#for bullet to appear and give a sound effect
fire_bullet()
```

## main.py
